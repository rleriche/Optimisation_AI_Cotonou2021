# Optimisation_AI_Cotonou2021
This is the project for the introduction to optimization class in Cotonou 2021
- Course notes are in `Slides/cours_optim_ML_Cotonou2021.pdf`.
- Project statement can be found in `Slides/project.pdf`.
- The `Project` directory contains R code for : gradient based descent algorithms (basic, with line search, with momentum and Nesterov acceleration), a restarted version of the descent algorithm, several test functions and associated visualizations. There is also a basic neural network whose training serves as an application. Everything is coded from scratch.
